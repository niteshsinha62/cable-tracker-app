## üèõÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

This application is built on a serverless architecture, leveraging powerful third-party services to handle the backend, which keeps the frontend lightweight and secure.

* **Frontend (Client-Side):**
    * A single-page application built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
    * **Tailwind CSS** is used for modern, responsive styling.
    * Hosted on **Netlify**, which provides continuous deployment directly from a GitHub repository.

* **Backend Services (Server-Side):**
    * **Firebase:** Acts as the core backend.
        * **Authentication:** Manages user logins and distinguishes between 'Admin' and 'Staff' roles.
        * **Firestore:** A real-time NoSQL database that stores all job log data. The frontend communicates directly with Firestore to read and write data.
    * **Cloudinary:**
        * Handles all image hosting. Staff-uploaded photos are sent directly to Cloudinary, which returns a URL that is then stored in the Firestore job log.

* **APIs & External Services:**
    * **Google Maps API:** Integrated on the frontend for interactive maps and location services.
    * **jsPDF & SheetJS:** Client-side libraries used for generating PDF and Excel reports.
